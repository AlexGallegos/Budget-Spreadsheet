# Budget Spreadsheet

> A budgeting and forecasting tool built with four tools:

- Microsoft Excel
- Perserverence
- A ***HEAVY*** reliance on snark
- Time
- Determination
- A much better ability to do math than you might think considering the number of bullet points in this section (I promise)

**Introduction**
Hello!

Thanks for checking out my budgeting spreadsheet. I've been slowly building up this Frankenstein's Monster of a spreadsheet ever since I was in college and I realized that just knowing how much money I had allocated for certain expenses wasn't enough - I also needed a rough idea of when money was coming in and when it was going out in order to know if things were A-OK, or if it was time to start selling bodily fluids. Whether you're just starting your budgeting journey or you've been doing it for years and just want some ideas, hopefully you find it useful. If you don't... well, it was free. You get what you pay for, right?

**Getting Started**

The first tab of the document is a fairly lengthy description of how to use the various features of the spreadsheet. If you're the sort of person who enjoys watching a demonstration instead of reading it, I made a YouTube demo, which <a href="#" target="_blank">you can check out right here!</a> I recommend the YouTube demonstration over trying to figure it out yourself but if you really are not an auditory learner, feel free to experiment with the spreadsheet plus the documentation on the first tab and figure things out at your own pace.

I have tried to make the spreadsheet itself as intuitive as I can, and it makes sense to me, but whether it will make sense to you or not somewhat depends on your brain working exactly the same way mine does. And I'm the sort of person who makes a GitHub Repository to host their budget spreadsheet to distribute to the world so, it's just now occuring to me as I write this that Your Mileage May Vary when it comes to getting onto the same train of logic that I've been riding since I started building this thing back in college. So, I took a few hours and wrote out the functionality as best I could and put it inside the document.

You'll also find when you open it that it's full of dummy data, as if it's the year 2020, January-April are over, and you're just going into the month of May, so the state of the sheet partway through the year will, hopefully, give you some clues as to how everything fits together as well.

**Anything Else?**

Hey, speaking of getting what you pay for earlier... it's now been a long time since I sold any bodily fluids, thankfully enough. This isn't anywhere close to my primary line of work, nor do I want it to be, which is why I'm not charging for it. But, if it made your life better and you decide you want to toss a couple monetary units in my direction, I'm not going to say "No" now am I? So if you are so inclined, feel free to toss a couple dollars into my virtual tip jar and <a href="#" target="_blank">do a thing</a>. If you want to. Or don't - your choice! This is one of those no-pressure scenarios you heard about. I just want to share this with people mostly. Thanks!
